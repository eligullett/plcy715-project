## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ej <- read.csv("C:/Users/gulle/OneDrive/Documents/gillings/EJSCREEN_2020_USPR.csv") 
ej
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
ej <- ej %>%
  filter(ST_ABBREV == "NC")
ej

ej <- ej %>%
  clean_names()%>%
  dplyr::select(-lingiso, -lingisopct)%>%
  mutate(fips = str_sub(id, start=1,end=5))%>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("t_"))%>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("p_"))%>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("b_"))%>%
  group_by(fips)%>%
  summarise_all(mean)
ej
```

Read in lead data

```{r}
lead <- read.csv("C:/Users/gulle/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/final-team-projects-darkolivegreen3/2019bloodtbl.csv")
lead
```


```{r}
lead %>% clean_names()
lead

lead <- lead %>%
  rename(county = ï..County)
lead

lead <- lead %>%
  rename(target_pop = Target.Population.)%>%
  rename(num_tested = Number.Tested)%>%
  rename(per_tested = Percent.Tested)%>%
  rename(num_high_lead = Lead.â...5)%>%
  rename(per_high_lead_h = Percent.â...5)%>%
  rename(num_tested_older = Number.Tested.1)%>%
  rename(five_nine = X5.9)%>%
  rename(very_high_lead_num = Lead.â...10)
lead


view(lead)
view(ej)

lead <- filter(lead, county != "STATE")
lead


lead$fips <- ej$fips
lead
```


Join
```{r}
full.join <- lead %>% 
 left_join(ej, by = "fips")
full.join
```
Read in Brownfields data
```{r}
brownfields <- read.csv("C:/Users/gulle/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/final-team-projects-darkolivegreen3/nc_brownfields_aggregated.csv")
view(brownfields)

brownfields$fips <- lead$fips
str(brownfields)
str(full.join)

as.numeric(brownfields$fips)
brownfields
as.numeric(full.join$fips)
full.join

brown_ej <- brownfields %>% 
 left_join(ej, by = "fips")
brown_ej

joined <- lead %>%
  full_join(brown_ej, by = "fips")
joined

write.csv(joined,"C:/Users/gulle/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/final-team-projects-darkolivegreen3/clean_full_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
